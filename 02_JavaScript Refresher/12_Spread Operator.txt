The spread operator in JavaScript is represented by three dots (...). It is a quick and easy way to "spread out" or expand elements of an array, object, or iterable into individual elements or properties.

Think of it Like Unpacking. Imagine you have a box of items (like an array or object), and the spread operator helps you take everything out of the box and lay it out.

Q: How Does It Work?
The spread operator can be used in arrays, objects, and even function arguments. Let's explore these scenarios.

How Does It Work?
The spread operator can be used in arrays, objects, and even function arguments. Let's explore these scenarios.

1. Spread in Arrays
Use Case: Copying an Array (Without the spread operator)
Example:
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
const fruitsCopy = fruits; // This creates a reference, not a new array
fruitsCopy.push("Date");
console.log(fruits); // Original array is also modified!

Use Case: Copying an Array (With the spread operator)
Example:
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
const fruitsCopy = [...fruits]; // Creates a new array
fruitsCopy.push("Date");
console.log(fruits);       // Original array is unchanged!
console.log(fruitsCopy);   // ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date"]

Use Case: Combining Arrays (Without the spread operator)
Example:
const arr1 = [1, 2];
const arr2 = [3, 4];
const combined = arr1.concat(arr2);
console.log(combined); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

Use Case: Combining Arrays (With the spread operator)
Example:
const arr1 = [1, 2];
const arr2 = [3, 4];
const combined = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(combined); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

2. Spread in Objects
Use Case: Copying an Object (Without the spread operator, you might use Object.assign)
Example:
const person = { name: "Omar", age: 25 };
const personCopy = Object.assign({}, person);

Use Case: Copying an Object (With the spread operator)
Example:
const person = { name: "Omar", age: 25 };
const personCopy = { ...person }; // Creates a new object
console.log(personCopy); // { name: "Omar", age: 25 }
