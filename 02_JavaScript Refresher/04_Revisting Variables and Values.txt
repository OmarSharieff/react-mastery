If you see applications such as Twitter or Google Maps, these apps are mostly about data. The tweets that you see are data, the feeds that are loaded on your screen are data. The location that you want to go to is a data, the route that is calculated to get there is also a data.

There are different types of Values (datatypes):
1. String
    - Text Values
    - Wrapped with single or double quotes
    - Can also be created with backticks ``
    Example: "Hello World", 'Hi there', `Yo Boy`
2. Number
    - Positive or negative
    - With decimal point (float) or without it (integer)
    Example: 5, -23, 3.14, -8.12
3. Boolean
    - True or false
    - A simple "Yes" or "No" value type
    - Typically used in conditions
    Example: true, false
4. Null/undefined
    - "There is no value."
    - undefined: Default if no value was assigned yet
    - null: Explicitly assigned by developer (reset value)
    Example: undefined, null

No matter what the data type is, if we want to store it then we use variables. Variables are data containers.

Why use Variables?
1. Reusability
    - Store a value in a variable once and use it as often and in as many places as needed.
2. Readability
    - Organize your code over several lines rather than cramming everything into a single line.

Key difference between 'let' and 'const'
1. let:
    - You can reassing the value after declaring the variable.
    Example:
    let name = "Alice";
    name = "Bob"; // This works!
    console.log(name); // Output: Bob

2. const:
    - You cannot reassign the value after declaring the variable.
    Example:
    const name = "Alice";
    name = "Bob"; // This throws an error!
