Arrow functions in JavaScript are a more concise way of writing functions. They use the => syntax. Here's a quick example: 
Instead of:
function(x) {return x*x}
You can write it as (x) => x*x
They're great for short functions and don't have their own 'this' context, which makes them especially handy in certain scenarios like array methods (e.g., map, filter).

The arrow function syntax is very popular with anonymous functions! But that doesn't mean you cannot create anonymous functions using the normal function declaration.
