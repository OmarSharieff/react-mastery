Array ia a data structure in JavaScript used to hold multiple values. In JavaScript, an array is a special type of object.

Q: What is an Array?
A: An array is a special type of object that is used to store an ordered list of values. These values (called elements) are accessed using a number-based index.
Example: const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

Q: How is an Array an Object?
A: Array is an Object Under the Hood. When you create an array, JavaScript treats it as an object where:
    i. The keys are numeric indices (0, 1, 2, etc.).
    ii. The values are the elements of the array.
Example:
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

// Internally, this array is similar to:
const fruitsAsObject = {
  0: "Apple",
  1: "Banana",
  2: "Cherry"
};

You can even access array elements using object syntax:
console.log(fruits[0]);          // Output: "Apple"
console.log(fruits["0"]);        // Output: "Apple" (works because keys are strings in objects)

Arrays Have Additional Features:

Arrays have special methods (like push, pop, map, etc.) that are not available in regular objects.
Arrays keep their keys (indices) in an ordered sequence, which is not guaranteed for regular objects.
Prototype Chain:

Arrays are based on the Array prototype, which provides all the built-in methods like push, pop, and sort.
The Array prototype itself is an object, which inherits from the base Object prototype.
Array Length:

Arrays automatically track their length (the number of elements), which is something a regular object doesnâ€™t do:
