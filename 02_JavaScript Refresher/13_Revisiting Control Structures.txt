Q: What are Control Structures in JavaScript?
A: Control structures are like road signs in a JavaScript program. They help guide the flow of your code, deciding what happens next based on certain conditions or repetitions.

Types of Control Structures
1. Conditional Statements
    - These control what code runs based on conditions (e.g., "If it's raining, take an umbrella").

2. Loops
    - These run the same block of code multiple times (e.g., "Keep eating until the plate is empty").

3. Switch Statements
    - These check a value and choose one of many possible actions (e.g., "If the light is red, stop; if green, go").
