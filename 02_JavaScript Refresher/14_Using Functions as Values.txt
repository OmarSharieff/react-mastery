In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens meaning that they can be treated like any other value.
We can assign functions to variables and then pass those variables as arguments when calling a function. For example:

let greeting = ()=> {
    console.log("Hi there");
}

function functionExecutor(fnc) {
    fnc()
}

functionExecutor(greeting) //Output: "Hi there"

There are some built-in function too that accept functions as values. For example:
setTimeout(()=> {
    console.log("timed out")
}, 2000)
