Objects in Javascript help you store multiple values at once. For example:
let userName = "Omar";
let userAge = 22

Instead of creating two separate variables to store name and age, we can simply create a user object like this:
let user = {
    name: "Omar",
    age: 22
}

To access the values inside the object like name or age we can use the . operator to tap into the objects property values
Example:
console.log(user.name) //Output: Omar
console.log(user.age) //Output: 22

You can also create functions inside objects. These functions are called as "methods". Yes, functions inside a object are called as methods.
Example:
let user = {
    name: "Omar",
    age: 22,
    greet(){
        console.log("Hi");
    }
}
In order to call this function, you can write 'user.greet()'

There also another way of creating objects with a template, and that is using classes. You know that by definition "classes are blueprints for objects" and thats true because they provide a template for object creation.
