Q: Why can't we just use Vanilla JavaScript?
A: 1) Writing complex JavaScript code becomes cumbersome
   2) Complex JavaScript code quickly becomes error-prone
   3) Complex JavaScript code often is hard to maintain or edit
   4) React offers a simpler mental model

The following are links to a demo website built using Vanilla JavaScript and React
Vanilla JavaScript: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/vanilla-js-demo-6049kj?file=%2Findex.js
React: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-vs-vanilla-demo-uc08fv?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js

NOTE: React follows declarative UI Programming approach, meaning you define the target UI state(s) - not the steps to get there! Instead, React will figure out & perform the necessary steps.
